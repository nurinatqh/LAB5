CASE STUDY:
Computer Vision (CV) is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) field enabling machines to interpret and understand
the visual world from images/videos, mimicking human sight using deep learning and algorithms to identify
objects, patterns, and actions for tasks like facial recognition, autonomous driving, medical analysis, and
quality control.
Computer vision operates similarly to human vision, although humans possess a significant advantage.
Human vision benefits from a lifetime of contextual experience, enabling the differentiation of objects,
assessment of distance, detection of motion, and identification of anomalies within an image.
